After your email data has been received and indexed, you can perform
archive searches. Nightly collections index the email and add it to the
archive. This article describes the steps for creating an archive search in the Archive Manager.

1\. Log in to the [Archive
    Manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f).
    For more information, see [Log in to the Archive
    Manager](/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager).

2\. On the left side of the screen, click **Search**.

3\. Click the **+New** tab.

  **Note**: This function is available for users with **Administrator**, **Compliance Officer**, and **Search Administrator** permissions only.

4\. Click the **Simple** or **Advanced** search tab.

-   **Simple** - Search for keywords, sender(from), recipient (to, cc, bcc), date, attachment, size, and hold.

-   **Advanced** - Search by sender, recipient, subject, body, and attachment with greater fine-tuning control. For more information, see the **Advanced search** section below.

5\. Enter the search terms, and then click **Search**.

6\. When the search returns the results click **Save**.

7\. Fill out the **Basic Information** section and click **Save**.

  **Note**: Only a **Search Name** is required to proceed.

-   In this section, you can designate users to have access to the search.


### Advanced search ###

Sometimes a search might require additional search criteria. In these cases, it is often best to use the **Advanced** option. The more specific the information you give, the better and more accurate the results are.

Enter as much available search information as possible in the fields under **Add Criteria**.

**Note**: If you require a more granular search, after selecting **Add Criteria**, click **Add Group**.
