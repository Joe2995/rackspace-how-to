#### Rackspace Archiving Release Notes ####
Rackspace Archiving is now better than ever. This upgrade provides many improvements, both in user experience, and in system performance. The new user experience includes a fully redesigned portal for managing the Archive.

Because the upgrade is fueled by many new core improvements, there are a few changes to your searches. Click here to read more about these changes.

Here’s a few notable examples:

The new platform will now have a direct URL for Archive Users to access the portal. Below is an example format of the URL:
-	https://view.archivesrvr.com/domaintld/ui/login


#### New Archive Dashboard ####

Providing quick and valuable insight to the health and activity of your archive.

#### Adding Archive Users ####
The new portal has taken a more direct approach to creating a new user to manage your archive. With this approach, the user’s role can now be selected based on company needs instead of clicking a separate section to accomplish the same end goal.

#### Save as New Search ####

Allows you to take an existing search and duplicate it as a new search. This saves time and effort by not having to start from scratch for each new search.

#### Improved Search Result Review ####

The look and feel of the search results review, including viewing specific messages, is greatly improved. Having a more “mail client feel”, navigating through the search results is more intuitive.

#### Improved Exports ####

Better filtering to limit size, export formats, and notifications provide a better experience, especially on larger exports.

#### Migration Notes ####
The migration that accompanies this upgrade is automatic, you will see one distinct difference. Any saved searches are migrated to the new archive portal as read-only; meaning you cannot edit/update the details of the search.

Since administrators and users are re-created as part of the upgrade/migration, the ownership of the migrated searches is not preserved. For these migrated searches, the new owner displays as “migrated search (unknown user).
