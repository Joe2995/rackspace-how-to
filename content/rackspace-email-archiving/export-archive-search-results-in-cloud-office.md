Archive search results can be exported to share with outside parties.
This can be helpful for auditing or legal requests, as well as historic
activity review by a team.

Complete the following steps to export the results of a search in
the Archive Manager.

1.  Log in to the [Archive
    Manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f).
    For more information, see [Log in to the Archive
    Manager](/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager).

2.  On the left side of the dashboard, click **Searches**.

3. 	Locate the search name to be exported and click **Run**.

    **Note**: This option will be available to users with **Administrator**, **Compliance Officer**, or **Search Administrator** permissions.

4. 	Then check the box for the messages to be exported and click the <img src="{% asset_path rackspace-email-archiving/export-archive-search-results/Export_icon.png %}" /> icon above the message list.
